## 1. Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases

| Feature | Flat File System | Relational Database |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Structure | Separate files (e.g., CSV) | Structured tables with keys |
| Redundancy | High | Low |
| Relationships | None | Enforced through keys |
| Querying | Limited | Powerful SQL queries |
| Example | Simple file storage | E-commerce & ERP systems |

**🔍 Summary:**  
Flat file systems are simple but suffer from redundancy and limited querying. Relational databases provide structure, reduce redundancy, and are ideal for complex applications.
